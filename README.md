## Introduction üßë‚Äçüíª

* In this project, a website was developed using flex display, inline block and float.
* This project was based on Danki code's Full Stack Master Course.
* The layout and manipulations of the elements were learned.
* After following the steps I made some changes to the layout, added some elements.
* Stacks Html and Css were used.


Come and contribute to my project.
